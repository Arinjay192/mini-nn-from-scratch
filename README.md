This project implements a simple feedforward neural network built from scratch using NumPy, trained on the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on their features. The notebook includes data preprocessing, one-hot encoding of labels, normalization, manual implementation of forward and backward propagation, and training using gradient descent. It concludes by evaluating the modelâ€™s performance and visualizing training accuracy over epochs.



besides this, we were given week wise assignments which included basic python at the start and slowly led to some more complex stuff like logistic regression and image classification as time went by. through this, i've gotten a good hang of python as a coding language and basics of machine learning and i hope to learn more as time goes by.
